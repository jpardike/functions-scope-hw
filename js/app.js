1. Verbal questions
Write answers to the following questions as comments.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?
2. Within a function, what is the difference between return and console.log?
3. What are the implications of the ability of a function to return a value?


*/

// 1. A parameter is like a placeholder in a function were an argument can be passed in it's place. An argument is something that you pass to a function that fills the parameter that the function needs to run.

// 2. Return returns the result of the function so it can be used outside of it. console.log will make a console log when the function is called and completes without giving access to the result outside the function.

// 3. The implications are that after the function completes, the value that is returned is accessible, which allows us to use the values that functions return elsewhere in our code.
